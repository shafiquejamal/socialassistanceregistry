socialassistanceregistry
========================

Basic application intake software for social assistance programs. Allows you create a web-based software to input social assistance applications

Feel free to check out the demo site: http://socialassistanceregistry.com

Installation Instructions
=========================

Create a root repository and copy all the files there. You'll need to set some environment variables. These you can find in the settings/base.py. I suppose I should give more instructions, but I'm at a loss.

Contact shafique.jamal@gmail.com if you have any questions, for help, etc. I'll do my best.

Enjoy!
